# Earthquake Tracking App - Technical Challenge
## Objective

Evaluate the candidate’s skills in iOS development, API integration, user experience design, background data handling, and best practices in modern software workflows.

## General Instructions
- Use Ѕwift and Ѕwift UI
- Integrate data from the [USGS Earthquake API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/)
- Follow a structured Git flow, reflecting your development rhythm.
- Push your work incrementally and explain your reasoning wherever it helps. Include a README.md.
- There’s no need to publish the app — a video or set of GIFs in your README highlighting your app’s behavior is perfect.
- *Push frequently, and make your commits meaningful* — don’t leave everything for one final shot. Let us see how your process shakes out over time.
- You’re free to adopt any Git branching strategy, just avoid pushing directly to main/master unless absolutely necessary.

> *🤝 Disclaimer*
> Kwema does NOT claim any rights over the code written as part of this technical challenge. You are free to keep working on your solution, improve it, or even publish it independently if you believe it has potential.

> Who knows — this might be the first version of an app that makes it all the way to your App Store.

# Challenge

Imagine living in Peru, one of the most seismically active countries on the planet. Right after an earthquake, your first instinct is to pull up key information: magnitude, location, intensity. Sadly, the local geological institute’s platform often goes offline at those crucial moments — leaving people confused, and vulnerable.

You’re building an app that delivers that missing peace of mind. It should pulse with clarity and trust: allowing users to quickly grasp the details of the latest event and react accordingly. Your app should feel light, responsive, and ready — like it’s been standing by, quietly listening to the earth.

## Part 1: The Epicenter

When the app comes to the foreground, it must immediately show what happened, where it happened, and its intensity. Essential information to be displayed includes:

- Ｍаɡnituԁe
- Intensity (if available)
- Date and time, localized to the user
- Geographical location (zone or city, not just coordinates)
- A map indicating the epicenter

The experience should trigger an instinctual reaction — “okay, I get what just happened.”

## Part 2: Global Earthquake Overview

If no recent earthquakes are registered in Peru, pull in the last 10 global seismic events and show them clearly, make sure your UI gracefully handles that. Each list item should include:

<!-- Great use case for RecyclerView with ViewHolders -->
- A small flag representing the country
- Magnitude of the Seismic event.
- Intensity (if available).


## Part 3: Visual Flow and User Interface

We’d love to see how you shape this experience — you’re free to structure the UI flow that best represents your design instincts.

- Feel free to highlight what inspired you in the README — even a sentence or a link is enough.
- Prioritize clarity, ease of use, and quick navigation

# Bonus Points

## Part 4: Passive Awareness (Background Fetch & Notifications)
<!-- Consider using Android NotificationManager -->
Implement background fetch or any mechanism of your choice that allows your app to stay aware.

- Periodically pull in new data and send a gentle notification like: “An earthquake of magnitude 6.3 struck Japan 18 minutes ago.”
- If the user taps the notification, open the app.


# Final Tip

We're interested not just in the code, but in how you think. Commit your reasoning, not just your code. Let your `README.md` reflect your decisions.
